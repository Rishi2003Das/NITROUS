# 🔁 Skill Swap Platform

A mini web application that enables users to **list their skills** and **request others in return** — making collaborative learning and mutual growth easier than ever.

## 🚀 Overview

The Skill Swap Platform is built for people who want to trade knowledge and skills — without spending money. Whether it's **Photoshop for Python**, **Excel for Singing**, or anything in between — users can connect, exchange skills, and learn together.

This platform was developed as part of **Odoo Hackathon '25**, under **Problem Statement 1**.
